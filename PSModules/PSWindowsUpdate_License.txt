I have been unable to find any licensing information for the PSWindowsUpdate modules. I am uncertain how it works.

I have downloaded the module from PSGallery using the Save-Module command in powershell.

The modules original location is here: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWindowsUpdate

Please follow any licencing guidelines found there. The reason to include it in the repository is simply because the training
environment has limites Internet Access.
